# ======================================
# Problem: C. Would It Be Unrated?
# Algorithm: Simple output
# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# ======================================
# This solution simply prints the number of tests
# The problem asks us to determine how many tests a problem has
# Based on the example, the answer is 25 tests
# However, the source code just prints 143
# This appears to be a joke/ April Fools implementation
print(143)
