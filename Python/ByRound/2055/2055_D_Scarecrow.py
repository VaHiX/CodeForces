# Problem: CF 2055 D - Scarecrow
# https://codeforces.com/contest/2055/problem/D

"""
D. Scarecrow

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Greedy approach with simulation
- Optimal movement of scarecrows to minimize crow's travel time
- Two-pointer or sequential processing of scarecrows
- Efficient handling of teleportation conditions

Time Complexity: O(n) per test case, where n is the number of scarecrows.
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding input storage.

The problem involves a crow moving along a number line and teleporting 
whenever it gets too close to a scarecrow. Scarecrows can move optimally to 
maximize the time before the crow teleports. The goal is to compute twice 
the minimum time needed for the crow to reach or exceed position â„“.
