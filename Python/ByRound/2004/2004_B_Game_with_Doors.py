B. Game with Doors
Algorithm: Interval overlap detection and minimal door locking calculation
Time Complexity: O(1) per test case - constant time operations
Space Complexity: O(1) - only using a fixed number of variables

The problem involves determining the minimum number of doors to lock between two intervals 
so that no path exists between any room in Alice's interval [l, r] and any room in Bob's interval [L, R].

Key insight:
- Doors are between consecutive rooms (i and i+1).
- To prevent Alice and Bob from meeting, we must block all potential paths.
- The minimum number of doors to lock equals the size of the overlapping region
  between the intervals [l,r] and [L,R], but adjusted for door positions.

Approach:
1. First check if intervals do not overlap at all â†’ return 1 (lock one door).
2. Otherwise, find the overlap interval.
3. Calculate how many doors are in that overlap.
4. Adjust for edge cases where segments touch but don't fully overlap.
