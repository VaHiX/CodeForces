# Problem: CF 2021 B - Maximize Mex

B. Maximize Mex

Algorithm/Technique: Greedy + Array Manipulation

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)

The problem asks to maximize the MEX (minimum excluded value) of an array by incrementing elements by x any number of times.
We use a frequency count approach to track how many times each value appears, and then simulate the process of "moving" values forward 
by x steps when there are duplicates, effectively allowing us to fill gaps in the sequence.

Key steps:
1. Count frequencies of all elements <= N (since MEX can't exceed N+1).
2. Iterate through possible indices and try to "shift" excess counts by x steps.
3. Find the first index where count is 0 â€” that's our answer.

        if CNT[i] > 1 and i + X < N + 2:  # If duplicate and can shift to next position
            CNT[i + X] += CNT[i] - 1  # Move extra occurrences forward by X steps
