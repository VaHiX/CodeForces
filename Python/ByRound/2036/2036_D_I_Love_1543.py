# Problem: CF 2036 D - I Love 1543
# https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/problem/D

"""
D. I Love 1543
Algorithm: Spiral Traversal + Pattern Matching
Time Complexity: O(n * m) per test case, where n and m are dimensions of the carpet.
Space Complexity: O(n * m) for storing the input grid and intermediate string representations.

The problem requires counting how many times the pattern "1543" appears in the spiral traversal 
of layers of a grid. Each layer is traversed clockwise, and multiple occurrences (overlapping 
or non-overlapping) are counted. 

For each layer:
- Extract top row (left to right)
- Extract right column (top to bottom, skipping corners)
- Extract bottom row (right to left)
- Extract left column (bottom to top, skipping corners)
Concatenate these four parts into one string.
Then, we append the first 3 characters of this string to itself and count how many times 
"1543" appears in it â€” to handle wraparound patterns that span across layer boundaries.

This approach processes each cell once per layer it belongs to.
