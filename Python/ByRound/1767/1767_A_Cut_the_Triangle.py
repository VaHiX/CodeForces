# Problem: CF 1767 A - Cut the Triangle
# https://codeforces.com/contest/1767/problem/A

"""
Code Purpose:
This code determines whether a given non-degenerate triangle can be cut into two non-degenerate triangles
by drawing a horizontal or vertical line. The approach is based on checking if there exist at least two
vertices with the same x-coordinate (for a vertical cut) or y-coordinate (for a horizontal cut), such that
the line passes through the triangle without degenerating it.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Coordinate analysis: Check for repeated x or y coordinates among the three vertices.
- Set operations: Use sets to detect duplicates in x and y coordinates.
- Logical condition: If there are at least two points with the same x or y coordinate, then a valid cut exists.

Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time operations (fixed number of vertices, fixed checks)
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space usage (fixed size data structures)
