F. Prefix Maximum Invariance
Algorithm: Monotonic stack with binary search optimization
Time Complexity: O(n log n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n)

The problem involves computing the sum of maximum number of positions where 
z[i] = y[i] over all possible arrays z that have the same prefix maxima as x.
We use a monotonic stack to efficiently track valid candidates for optimal z.

For each subarray [l, r], we compute f(a[l:r+1], b[l:r+1]) which equals:
- For each position i in the subarray, we try to place b[i] in z[i]
- We want z[i] such that prefix maxima stay the same as in a
- The answer is the count of positions where this can be done optimally

The key insight is that for a valid array z, at each position i,
z[i] â‰¤ max(a[0:i]) (to maintain prefix maxima).
We use stack + binary search to efficiently compute how many such placements work.
