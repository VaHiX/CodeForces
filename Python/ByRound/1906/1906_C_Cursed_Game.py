Cursed Game Solver

Algorithm:
This is a game-solving problem where we need to determine the location of holes in a 3x3 secret grid by querying a larger NÃ—N grid. 
The key insight is to use XOR properties and strategic queries to identify which cells have holes.

Approach:
1. For N=3, randomly generate a 3x3 grid and query until we get a "CORRECT" response. This works because the secret grid is fixed and we're trying to identify it.
2. For N>3:
   - First, we query a grid where only the bottom-right cell (3,3) is black.
   - The result tells us which 3x3 subregions of the secret grid have holes (based on how many black cells are visible).
   - Then, we strategically construct a new grid to determine the exact positions of the holes using XOR operations.
   
Time Complexity: O(N^2) per round on average, where N is the size of the query grid.
Space Complexity: O(N^2) for storing the grids.

The algorithm works by treating the problem as a system of linear equations in GF(2) and using queries to solve it.
