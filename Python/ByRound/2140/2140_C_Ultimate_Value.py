# Problem: CF 2140 C - Ultimate Value

C. Ultimate Value

Purpose:
This problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take alternating turns to maximize or minimize the value of a function f(a) defined over an array a, with each turn allowing a swap operation that increases cost by (r - l). Both players play optimally.

The function f(a) is computed as:
f(a) = cost + (a1 - a2 + a3 - a4 + ... Â± an)

Approach:
- We precompute the base value of f(a) without any swaps.
- Then simulate the optimal moves based on the parity of indices and attempt to find the best gain from swapping elements, considering both minimizing and maximizing strategies.
- The key part is calculating the maximum possible benefit from a single swap of two elements using a greedy-like approach.

Time Complexity: O(n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n)
