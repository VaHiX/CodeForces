# Problem: CF 2084 B - MIN = GCD
# https://codeforces.com/contest/2084/problem/B

"""
B. MIN = GCD

Purpose:
This code determines whether a given sequence of integers can be rearranged such that 
there exists an index i (1 â‰¤ i < n) where the minimum of the first i elements equals 
the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the remaining elements.

Algorithm/Technique:
- Sort the array to process elements in ascending order.
- For each element after the first, check if it's divisible by the first element.
  If so, compute the GCD of all such divisible elements.
- The key insight is that if we can form a valid split, then the GCD of the suffix 
  must equal the first element (as it's the minimum of prefix and also a divisor of
  all elements in the suffix).
- Time Complexity: O(n log n + n log M), where M is the maximum value in array.
  Sorting takes O(n log n), and computing GCDs can take up to O(n log M) due to 
  Euclidean algorithm being applied multiple times.
- Space Complexity: O(1), excluding input storage.

Time Complexity: O(n log n + n log M)
Space Complexity: O(1)
