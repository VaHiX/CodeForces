"""
B. XOR Palindromes
Given a binary string s of length n, determine for each number x from 0 to n whether there exists a binary string l of length n with exactly x ones such that s âŠ• l is a palindrome.

Algorithm:
- For each test case, compute the number of mismatches between s[i] and s[n-i-1] for i in range(n//2).
- If n is odd, we can have at most (n - 2*c + 1) positions where we can place a '1' in the middle.
- If n is even, we can place '1's in pairs to make the result palindrome.
- Use dynamic construction of the output string t based on matched/unmatched characters.

Time Complexity: O(n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding input/output

    # Build the output string based on number of mismatches
    if n % 2:
        # If length is odd, place zeros for mismatches, one in the center, then zeros again
