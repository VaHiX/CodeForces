# Problem: CF 2106 F - Goblin

"""
F. Goblin

Purpose:
This code solves the problem of finding the maximum size of a connected component of '0's in an n√ón grid,
where each row i represents a binary string formed by flipping the i-th character of the input string s.
The solution uses dynamic programming to track the longest path extending from each cell in two directions:
top-down and bottom-up, and computes the maximum over all cells.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Preprocessing of flip strings into a grid

Time Complexity: O(n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing top and bot arrays plus input
