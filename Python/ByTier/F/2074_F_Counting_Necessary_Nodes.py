F. Counting Necessary Nodes

Purpose:
This code computes the minimum number of nodes required in a quadtree to exactly cover a given rectangular region [l1, r1] Ã— [l2, r2].

The algorithm uses inclusion-exclusion principle over all possible quadtree levels (bit lengths), where for each level we count how many nodes contribute and adjust overlaps.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
- Bit manipulation to iterate through powers of 2 (quadtree levels)
- Coordinate compression based on powers of 2

Time Complexity: O(log(min(r1 - l1, r2 - l2)))
Space Complexity: O(1)

Input Format:
Each test case contains four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 representing the boundaries of a rectangle.

Output Format:
For each test case, output the minimum number of nodes needed to cover the rectangle exactly.

        # Subtract 3 times number of such full squares to account for overcounting in inclusion-exclusion
