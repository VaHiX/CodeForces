# Problem: CF 1952 D - Are You a Procrastinator?
# https://codeforces.com/contest/1952/problem/D

"""
Task: Determine if user is a procrastinator based on input
Algorithm: Simple input/output operation
Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time operation
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage

The problem appears to be a simple placeholder or example problem where
the solution directly outputs "yes" regardless of input. This suggests
the task might be testing basic input/output handling or is a sample
problem for a coding contest.
"""

print("yes")  # Output the fixed result "yes" as per problem requirements
