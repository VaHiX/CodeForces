# CODEFORCES EYE TESTING SYSTEM APRIL FOOLS YOU READ POORLY GET EYEGLASSES
# Algorithm: Direct indexing into a pre-defined list of words
# Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time lookup
# Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space for the string list

        int(input()) - 1  # Convert input to integer and subtract 1 for 0-based indexing
