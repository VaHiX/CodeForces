H. 23 Rises Again

Purpose:
This code solves a problem involving finding the maximum number of edges in a "candy" subgraph of a given graph.
A candy graph is defined as a graph where every vertex has degree at most 2.
The algorithm attempts to construct such a graph by iteratively selecting or modifying edges using randomization and greedy strategies.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Randomized greedy approach with backtracking (via rejection sampling)
- Degree-based edge selection and modification
- Graph representation using adjacency lists

Time Complexity: O(n^2 * NUM) per test case, where NUM is a fixed large constant (10000),
                 and n is the number of vertices. In practice, this is efficient for small n (â‰¤30).

Space Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.
                  This includes storage for adjacency lists, degrees, and edge information.

Input:
- Multiple test cases
- For each test case:
  - Two integers n and m representing vertices and edges
  - m lines containing pairs of integers u, v indicating an edge

Output:
- Maximum number of edges in a candy subgraph
