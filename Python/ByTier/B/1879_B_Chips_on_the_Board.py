# Problem: CF 1879 B - Chips on the Board

"""
Algorithm: Chips on the Board

Purpose:
This problem requires placing chips on an n√ón board such that every cell has at least one chip in its row or column.
Each chip at position (i,j) has a cost of a[i] + b[j]. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

Key Insight:
To cover all cells optimally, we can either:
1. Place chips in rows such that each row has at least one chip (minimum cost is sum of all a[i] + n * min(b))
2. Place chips in columns such that each column has at least one chip (minimum cost is sum of all b[i] + n * min(a))

We try both strategies and take the minimum.

Time Complexity: O(n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space (not counting input storage)
