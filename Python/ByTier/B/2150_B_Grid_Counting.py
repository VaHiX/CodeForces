B. Grid Counting

Approach:
This problem involves counting valid configurations of black cells in an nÃ—n grid under specific constraints.

Key Observations:
- For each row k, exactly a_k cells must be black.
- Each "max(x_i, y_i) = k" value is unique for exactly one cell.
- Each "max(x_i, n+1-y_i) = k" value is unique for exactly one cell.
  
These constraints indicate that:
- The black cells form a pattern where we can think of them distributed in rows from top to bottom,
  such that for row i, a_i black cells are placed.
- The constraint on "max(x_i, y_i)" ensures that the rightmost black cell in each row is unique and increasing.
- The constraint on "max(x_i, n+1-y_i)" ensures similar for diagonal with respect to bottom-left to top-right.

This leads to a dynamic programming type solution where:
- We maintain how many cells are allowed (cur) to be placed at each level.
- At each row from the middle outwards, we calculate binomial coefficients for placing a_i black cells in available positions.
- If it's impossible (e.g., exceeding the number of available slots), return 0.
