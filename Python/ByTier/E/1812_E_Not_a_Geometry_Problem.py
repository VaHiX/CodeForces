Problem: E. Not a Geometry Problem

Algorithms/Techniques: Mathematical computation
Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time operations
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space usage

The problem seems to involve some mathematical computation based on three integers x, y, z.
However, the provided code just reads the input and prints 0, which doesn't match any of the
expected outputs from the examples, suggesting this might be a placeholder or the actual
solution logic is missing from the code snippet.
"""

x, y, z = (int(a) for a in input().split()) # Read three integers from input
print(0) # Placeholder output - not the actual solution
