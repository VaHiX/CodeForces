E. Alternating String

Problem Description:
Given a string of lowercase Latin letters, determine the minimum number of operations required to make it an alternating string. An alternating string has all even-positioned characters the same and all odd-positioned characters the same, and its length must be even.

Two types of operations are allowed:
1. Delete one character (at most once).
2. Replace one character with any other letter.

Algorithm:
- If the string length is odd, we can consider deleting one character to make it even, then compute minimum changes needed.
- For even-length strings:
  - Count frequency of characters at odd and even indices separately.
  - The minimal operations needed = total length - max(odd_freq) - max(even_freq)
- For odd-length strings:
  - First try keeping the string as-is (checking if it's already alternating).
  - Otherwise, simulate deleting one character (at most once), and for each deletion position, compute changes needed.
  
Time Complexity: O(n) per test case, where n is the length of the string.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” only using fixed-size arrays of size 26 for character counts.
