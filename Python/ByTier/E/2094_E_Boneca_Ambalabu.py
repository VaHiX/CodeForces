E. Boneca Ambalabu

Problem: Given a sequence of n integers, find the maximum value of sum of XORs (a_k âŠ• a_i) for all i in 1..n,
where k is chosen optimally from 1 to n.

Approach:
- For each bit position, count how many numbers have that bit set to 1.
- For each number a_k, compute the maximum possible sum of XORs by choosing
  the optimal bit value (0 or 1) for each bit position to maximize the contribution.
- This is done greedily from most significant bit to least significant.

Time Complexity: O(30 * n) = O(n), where n is the total number of elements across all test cases
Space Complexity: O(1) not counting input/output, O(30) for count array which is constant

Algorithms/Techniques: Bit manipulation, greedy algorithm on bit representation.
