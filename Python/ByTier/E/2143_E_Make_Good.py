E. Make Good

Algorithm:
This problem involves transforming a bracket string into a valid (regular) bracket sequence using two specific operations:
1. Replace "((" with "))" 
2. Replace "))" with "(("

Key insight:
- The operations essentially allow swapping pairs of adjacent brackets.
- A valid bracket sequence has equal numbers of '(' and ')' and never has more ')' than '(' at any prefix.
- We use a stack to simulate the matching process by pairing consecutive brackets.
- For each pair of identical adjacent brackets, we can "consume" them through the operations and count how many such pairs we could form (this is m).
- If we can't balance everything or end up with invalid starting/ending brackets, we output -1.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack and temporary structures.
