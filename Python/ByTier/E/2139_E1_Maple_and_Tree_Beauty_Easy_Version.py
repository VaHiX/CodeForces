E1. Maple and Tree Beauty (Easy Version)

This problem involves a rooted tree where each node must be labeled with either 0 or 1,
with exactly k zeros and (n - k) ones. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest
common subsequence (LCS) among all leaf nodes' "names" â€” strings formed by concatenating
node labels from root to that node.

The algorithm builds a tree from input, traverses level-by-level to track number of leaves
at each depth. It then attempts to distribute k zeros optimally across levels to maximize
the LCS of leaf names.

Key idea:
- First determine the maximum number of layers possible (tree height)
- Use dynamic programming with bitmasks (dp) to check combinations of how many 0s
  to place in each layer so that total 0s equals k and both k and (n-k) constraints are respected
- If we cannot satisfy constraint using all layers, reduce the layer count until feasible

Time Complexity: O(n^2 + 2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Tree building from parent array
- BFS-like traversal to identify layer structure
- Bitmask dynamic programming for subset sum matching
