# Problem: CF 1957 C - How Does the Rook Move?
# https://codeforces.com/contest/1957/problem/C

"""
Purpose: 
This code solves the problem of counting the number of different final configurations 
possible in a game where white and black rooks are placed on an n√ón chessboard. 
The game alternates between the player (who places white rooks) and the computer 
(who places black rooks). When a player places a rook at (r, c), the computer mirrors 
it to (c, r), unless r == c, in which case the computer skips its turn. 
The goal is to count how many distinct final configurations are possible after 
k moves by the player (with the computer mirroring them), assuming optimal play.

The solution involves:
- Tracking the number of unused rows and columns after k moves.
- Using dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations 
  that can be made in the remaining squares, based on a recurrence relation.

Key Algorithm/Techniques:
- Dynamic Programming with the recurrence:
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2], where dp[i] represents the number
    of configurations for i unused rows/columns.
- Efficient precomputation of dp values for all relevant inputs to handle multiple test cases.

Time Complexity: O(n) - since we precompute dp values up to max n in the input.
Space Complexity: O(n) - to store the dp array of size up to 3 * 10^5.
