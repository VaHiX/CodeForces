Problem: print("puzzling")

Algorithms/Techniques: Simple output operation

Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time operation
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage

This code performs a basic print operation to display the string "puzzling"
to the standard output. The operation involves no complex algorithms or
data structures, simply outputting a pre-defined string literal.
