G. Bugged Sort

Problem Description:
Given two arrays 'a' and 'b' of length n each, containing all integers from 1 to 2*n exactly once,
determine if both arrays can be sorted in increasing order simultaneously using a special swap operation.

Swap Operation:
- Given indices i and j (i â‰  j), swap a[i] with b[j], and swap b[i] with a[j].
This means elements are exchanged between the two arrays while keeping their relative positions.

Algorithm:
The key insight is to model this as a graph problem where each element in [1, 2*n] forms a cycle.
We process elements one by one and group them into cycles. For each cycle, we check whether we can
arrange the elements such that both arrays end up sorted. This involves checking parity conditions.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
