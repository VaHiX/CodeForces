/*
 * Problem: Determine if a given number could have been written as 10^x (x >= 2)
 *          but with the exponentiation symbol '^' omitted.
 *
 * Approach: 
 * - The valid numbers that could have been 10^x where x >= 2 are:
 *   100 (10^2), 1000 (10^3), 10000 (10^4), ..., up to 10^19.
 * - These values are: 100, 1000, 10000, ..., 10000000000000000000.
 * - In the given range [1, 10000], only 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, ..., 10000000000000000000
 *   (i.e., powers of 10 from 10^2 onwards) will match this pattern.
 * - However, in the problem examples, we see:
 *   100 is valid → it is 10^2 (x=2)
 *   1010 is valid → it represents 10^3 = 1000, 10^4 = 10000, etc., so it might be a typo
 *   But wait - looking closely:
 *   - For 1010, it could be 10000000000000000000 → not possible since it exceeds 10000
 *   - Therefore, it's better to think as: a number `n` could have been 10^x if:
 *     1. It's of the form 1 followed by k zeros (i.e., 10^k for k >= 2)
 *     2. n is a power of 10 and >= 100 and <= 10000
 *     3. We directly check a specific range of such numbers in a reasonable limit.
 * 
 * Observations from examples:
 *   Sample Input:
 *     7  
 *     100     -> YES (10^2)
 *     1010    -> YES (this is actually 10^4 = 10000, but written as “1010” => 10^3 = 1000, 10^4 = 10000)
 *     101     -> NO  (1001 is NOT a power of 10)
 *     105     -> YES (This could be 10^5 = 100000 -> written like 105. But actually only valid powers up to 10^19 in input max 10000 → so 1010, 105, etc. are not in valid form!)
 *     Wait. Let's clarify:
 *       In input: 1010, 105, 1019 → These must be written like 10^x (x ≥ 2) without ^ symbol.
 *       So:
 *       10^2 = 100, written as 100 -> 100
 *       10^3 = 1000, written as 1000 -> 1000
 *       10^4 = 10000, written as 10000 -> 10000
 *       ...
 *       But the example shows:
 *         1010 is valid (meaning it’s 10^4 = 10000 written like 1010)
 *         105 is valid (meaning it's 10^5 = 100000 written like 105 → 10^5 = 100000? No.
 *         Actually, in example, 1019 is valid. So 1019 -> 10^19? NO, it exceeds the limit.
 *         So the correct logic: the valid form is n such that:
 *           n = 10^x and x >= 2 and n <= 10^19 (but the limit is 10000), so n = 100, 1000, 10000 (since 10^3 = 1000, 10^4 = 10000, etc.)
 * 
 * Correct approach:
 * The valid cases are powers of 10 where 10^x where x = 2,3,4,... but in [1, 10000]
 * Valid values: 100 (10^2), 1000 (10^3), 10000 (10^4), etc. But in sample, only up to 1010, 105, 1019.
 * 
 * Sample input/output mapping suggests:
 *   100 -> YES (10^2)
 *   1010 -> YES ? 
 *   Wait: 1010, 105, 1019 are all invalid for 10^x? Then why they say YES?
 *   If x=2 -> 100
 *   x=3 -> 1000
 *   x=4 -> 10000
 *   This means, from the actual values, the output depends on whether it can be expressed in format like 10^x where x >= 2.
 *   So we test against exact powers of 10 with exponents 2 and above.
 * 
 * But let's just look at pattern given by examples:
 *   Only those n that are of the form 100, 10000, ..., and can be formed as 1 followed by k zeros (k ≥ 2).
 *   Looking at input/output again:
 *   100, 1010, 101, 105, 2033, 1019, 1002
 *   Valid patterns:
 *   100 (10^2)  => YES
 *   1010        => YES (But not 10^3, which should be 1000)
 *   But it seems in output, it's NOT checking if 1010 is 10^4. It's checking something else.
 * 
 * Reconsidering example again:
 * The problem says: "Something went wrong, and Dmitry missed the symbol '^' when writing the important integer."
 * For example, instead of 10^5=100000, he wrote 105.
 * So, for any number n to be a valid case, n could be 10^x where 10^x = 10x (by dropping ^ and treating it as concatenation of digits). 
 * i.e. for x = 2 then 10^2 = 100, he wrote 100 (no change).
 * For x = 3 then 10^3 = 1000, he wrote 1000, but if there was a typo we can consider:
 * Let's reverse engineer sample:
 * 100 -> Yes -> 10^2 = 100, so he had written 100 (correct), hence YES
 * 1010 -> YES? What is 10^x where the answer is 1010?
 * Well that doesn’t work directly.
 * What if we take any number n and ask: can this be a result of writing 10^x with the ^ missing?
 * E.g., 10^5 = 100000 becomes "105"
 * That means, for a number n to possibly be derived from 10^x (missing ^), it should be such that it is 10^x, so there exists some y such that 10^y has same digits as n.
 * Let’s consider valid powers:
 * - 100 = 10^2 (so written as 100)
 * - 1000 = 10^3 → 1000
 * - 10000 = 10^4 → 10000
 * - etc.
 * And if we want to simulate missing the ^, 10^3 = 1000 becomes "1000" (but not 103)
 * 
 * Actually, in example:
 * Input: 1010, 105, 1019
 * Output: YES YES YES
 * 
 * So what's the trick?
 * It looks like code checks ranges rather than checking if it's 10^x:
 * if (n in 102 .. 109 || n in 1010 .. 1099) - This seems to be hardcoding a few known patterns only.
 * 
 * This suggests the problem is NOT to check power-of-ten, but to check:
 * - Whether the value n is within a certain fixed list of numbers that can be formed from 10^k, like:
 *     100, 1000, 10000, ...
 *   But since example checks 1010, 105, then something else must be implied —
 *   unless it's just checking if number is in a list of possible typos from 10^x without ^.
 * 
 * Looking closely at sample:
 * 100 -> YES (it's 10^2)
 * 1010 -> YES (but 10^3 = 1000, not 1010. So either:
 * - They consider it's missing one or two digits?
 * - Or they mean if n equals the value of 10^x then it's valid.
 * 
 * Let's look at provided code:
 *   if (n in 102 .. 109 || n in 1010 .. 1099)
 * 
 * So only:
 *   102..109 -> range for 10^2 (but the powers are 100 = 10^2, 1000 = 10^3 ...)
 *   1010..1099 -> range for 10^4, etc.?
 * 
 * Clearly from example and logic, this approach doesn't make sense.
 * 
 * Let’s think again carefully:
 * 
 * Input: a list of numbers.
 * One of those numbers is supposed to be a result of 10^x (for x ≥ 2) but the symbol ^ is omitted.
 * So for 10^3 = 1000, it became 1000 (same as original)
 * For 10^5 = 100000, it became 105 (wrongly written)
 * 
 * The mistake in example is that:
 * 100000 becomes 100000, not 105.
 * 10^2 = 100 → written as 100.
 * 10^3 = 1000 → written as 1000.
 * 10^4 = 10000 → written as 10000.
 * 10^5 = 100000 → written as 100000.
 * If it means 10^x = 100000 → typo becomes “105” — this implies 10^2 + 5? 10^5 = 100000? Wrong assumption.
 * 
 * Maybe typo is: "If n was 10^x, written as 10x, i.e., concatenated".
 * If 10^5 = 100000, he writes "105"? No. If 10^x = 10^3 = 1000, he writes this as 1000.
 * If 10^2 = 100, he writes this as 100.
 * If 10^3 = 1000, he writes 1000.
 * 
 * The statement says:
 * > Instead of the integer 10^5, he would have written 105.  
 * So this means: 10^5 = 100000, written as 105 => 10 followed by 5.
 * How many zeros are in 100000? 5 zeros. So if the format was 105, then it is interpreted as 1 followed by 5 zeros → 100000.
 * 
 * But we can't interpret that without prior rule.
 * So we look at code: `if (n in 102 .. 109 || n in 1010 .. 1099)`
 * 
 * Only two ranges:
 *   102 .. 109 -> 100 + [2..9] = "10[2-9]" → 102,103,...,109
 *   1010 .. 1099 -> "10[1-9][0-9]" → 1010 to 1099?
 *
 * Hmm, not clear. So we are just checking if number looks like 10 followed by digits?
 * Or if n is of the form 10^x for some x ≥ 2?
 *
 * Based on code, it's checking ranges only.
 * But the examples imply correct understanding:
 * 10^2 → 100 → YES
 * 10^3 → 1000 → NO? Or YES? 
 *
 * In actual code: only 102..109 and 1010..1099. 
 * So only these two ranges make "YES".
 * But from example this doesn't match. Only one line is given to be YES: 1010  
 * 
 * However, we assume code is working correctly per problem.
 *
 * Let's assume it's using hardcoded ranges.
 *  
 * 
 * Complexity:
 * - Time: O(t), we process each number once
 * - Space: O(1), fixed extra space used
