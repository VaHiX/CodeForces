// Problem: CF 2156 C - Maximum GCD on Whiteboard
// https://codeforces.com/contest/2156/problem/C

/*
 * Problem: Maximum GCD on Whiteboard
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * - Use a frequency histogram to count occurrences of each number.
 * - For each candidate gcd value (from n down to 1), determine how many numbers
 *   can be transformed or removed to make all remaining numbers divisible by this candidate.
 * - Use prefix sums to efficiently calculate how many numbers are â‰¤ some threshold.
 * - A number x can be split into three parts (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = x,
 *   and only a and c are kept. This effectively allows us to "reduce" x to a value
 *   that's at most x/3 in some contexts, but more importantly, it lets us increase
 *   our ability to find common factors.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n * sqrt(n)) in the worst case due to checking candidates
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for histogram and prefix sum arrays
