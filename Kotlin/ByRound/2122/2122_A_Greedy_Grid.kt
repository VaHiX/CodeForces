// Problem: CF 2122 A - Greedy Grid
// https://codeforces.com/contest/2122/problem/A

/*
 * Purpose: Determines if there exists an nÃ—m grid of nonnegative integers such that no greedy path achieves the maximum value among all down/right paths.
 * 
 * Algorithm/Techniques: Greedy Grid Analysis
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1) per test case, as the decision is based on a simple condition check.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), only using constant extra space regardless of input size.
