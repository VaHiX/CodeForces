// Problem: CF 1463 A - Dungeon
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1463/problem/A

/*
 * Problem: Dungeon
 * 
 * Algorithm/Technique: Mathematical Analysis
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time operations for each test case
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Each regular shot deals 1 damage to one monster.
 * - Every 7th shot is enhanced and deals 1 damage to all monsters.
 * - The goal is to kill all monsters with the same enhanced shot (i.e., the 7th, 14th, 21st, etc.).
 * - This means that the total damage dealt before the enhanced shot must be such that the final 
 *   enhanced shot kills all monsters.
 * 
 * Key Insight:
 * - For this to happen, each monster must have at least enough damage dealt to it by regular shots 
 *   before the enhanced shot, plus the damage from the enhanced shot.
 * - Letâ€™s say we perform `k` shots, which include `k / 7` enhanced shots and `k - k / 7` regular shots.
 * - However, we are only interested in the moment when all monsters are killed by the same enhanced shot.
 * - That means, the total health points of the monsters divided by 9 (3 monsters * 3 regular shots each) 
 *   gives how many full cycles of 7 shots are required to kill monsters with one enhanced shot.
 * 
 * So, if (a + b + c) is divisible by 9 and:
 * - a >= (a + b + c) / 9,
 * - b >= (a + b + c) / 9, 
 * - c >= (a + b + c) / 9,
 * Then it is possible to do so.
 * 
 * The condition simplifies to checking whether the total health is divisible by 9,
 * and if each monster has at least (total_health / 9) health points.
