// Problem: CF 1341 A - Nastya and Rice
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1341/problem/A

ï»¿/*
 * Problem: Nastya and Rice
 * Purpose: Determine if the given constraints on individual grain weights and total package weight are consistent.
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * - For each test case, calculate the minimum and maximum possible total weights based on individual grain constraints.
 * - Check if the feasible range of total weights [min, max] overlaps with the given range [c - d, c + d].
 * - If there's an overlap, then it's possible to assign weights to grains such that the total weight falls in the required range.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(t), where t is the number of test cases. Each case is processed in constant time.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), only a constant amount of extra space is used.
