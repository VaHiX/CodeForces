// Problem: CF 1881 E - Block Sequence
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1881/problem/E

ï»¿/*
 * Problem: E. Block Sequence
 * 
 * Algorithm/Technique: Dynamic Programming
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the sequence. Each element is processed once.
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for the dp array.
 * 
 * The approach uses dynamic programming to determine the minimum number of deletions required
 * to make a sequence beautiful. A beautiful sequence consists of blocks where each block
 * starts with its own length, followed by that many elements.
 * 
 * The DP state dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the sequence
 * starting from index i beautiful.
 * 
 * Transition:
 * - If we can form a valid block starting at index i (i + a[i] + 1 <= n), then:
 *   - We can either skip the current element (add 1 to dp[i+1]) or
 *   - Use the block (take dp[i + a[i] + 1] if valid)
 * - Otherwise, we must delete the current element.
 * 
 * The base case is dp[n - 1] = 1, since a single element is never a valid block and needs to be deleted.
