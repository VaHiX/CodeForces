// Problem: CF 1928 A - Rectangle Cutting
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1928/problem/A

/*
 * Problem: Rectangle Cutting
 * 
 * Purpose: Determine if a rectangle of size a√ób can be cut into two integer-sided rectangles,
 *          and then rearranged to form a different rectangle (considering rotations as the same).
 * 
 * Algorithms/Techniques:
 * - Mathematical analysis of possible cuts and resulting configurations
 * - Check divisibility and equality conditions to determine if reconfiguration is possible
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time per test case, as all operations are basic arithmetic checks.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a fixed amount of variables are used, regardless of input size.

      // The logic checks three conditions:
      // 1. Both dimensions are even -> can cut into two rectangles with integer sides
      // 2. a is even but a/2 != b -> can form a new rectangle
      // 3. b is even but b/2 != a -> can form a new rectangle
