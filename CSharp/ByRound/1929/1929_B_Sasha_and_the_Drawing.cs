// Problem: CF 1929 B - Sasha and the Drawing

/*
 * Problem: Sasha and the Drawing
 * Purpose: Determine the minimum number of cells to color in an n√ón grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * - The grid has 4n - 2 diagonals in total.
 * - Each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
 * - To minimize the number of cells, we try to cover as many unique diagonals as possible per cell.
 * - If k <= (4n - 4), we can cover k diagonals with (k + 1) / 2 cells (since each cell covers at most 2 diagonals).
 * - If k > (4n - 4), we use a greedy approach: after placing cells to cover (4n - 4) diagonals optimally (with (4n - 4)/2 cells),
 *   we need to cover the remaining (k - (4n - 4)) diagonals, which requires exactly (k - (4n - 4)) additional cells.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time operations
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only using fixed amount of memory for variables
