// Problem: CF 2045 C - Saraga
// https://codeforces.com/contest/2045/problem/C

ï»¿/*
 * Problem: C. Saraga
 * 
 * Algorithm/Techniques:
 * - Preprocessing: For each string S and T, we precompute the first occurrence of each character from the start of S and the last occurrence of each character from the end of T.
 * - Matching: For every character that appears in both S and T, we calculate the minimum length of an interesting abbreviation using that character as a common point.
 * - Optimization: Use arrays of size 26 to track character positions, allowing O(1) lookup for each character.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(|S| + |T|) where |S| and |T| are the lengths of the two input strings.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) as we use fixed-size arrays of 26 elements for character tracking.
