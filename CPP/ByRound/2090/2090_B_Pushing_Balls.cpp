// Problem: CF 2090 B - Pushing Balls
// https://codeforces.com/contest/2090/problem/B

/*
B. Pushing Balls
Algorithms/Techniques: Simulation with directional propagation logic
Time Complexity: O(n * m) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n * m) for storing the grid and the reachability matrix

The problem simulates pushing balls into an n√óm grid from either left or top edges.
Each ball continues moving until it hits another ball or reaches the edge.
We check whether the final state is achievable by:
1. Marking all positions reachable from leftward pushes (row-wise)
2. Marking all positions reachable from upward pushes (column-wise)
3. Ensuring that every '1' in the grid is reachable from at least one direction
