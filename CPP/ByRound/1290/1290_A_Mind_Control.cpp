// Problem: CF 1290 A - Mind Control
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1290/problem/A

/*
 * Problem: Mind Control
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   This code solves a game theory problem where players take turns picking elements
 *   from either end of an array, with the goal being to determine the minimum value
 *   that the player in position 'm' can guarantee to obtain under optimal control
 *   of up to k other players.
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. For each valid starting position where we begin our turn (from 0 to k),
 *      simulate all possible subarrays of length (m - k) that could be left for us.
 *   2. For each such subarray, compute the maximum of the two ends of the range
 *      and track the minimum among them â€” representing worst-case gain for our turn.
 *   3. Optimize by trying all possible placements of our controlled players,
 *      taking the best such value across all configurations.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(k * (m - k)) per test case = O(n^2) in worst case.
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for the array storage and auxiliary space.
