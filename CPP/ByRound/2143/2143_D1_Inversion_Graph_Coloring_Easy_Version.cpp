D1. Inversion Graph Coloring (Easy Version)
Algorithms/Techniques: Dynamic Programming, Inversion Graphs
Time Complexity: O(n^3)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

This problem asks for counting the number of "good" subsequences in a given array.
A subsequence is good if we can color its elements red or blue such that:
- For every pair of indices i < j with b_i > b_j, colors assigned to i and j are different.
This is equivalent to saying: there's no inversion (i,j) where i<j and b_i > b_j in the subsequence,
such that both elements have the same color â€” hence it's a valid 2-coloring of an inversion graph.

We use dynamic programming with state f[i][j] which represents the number of ways to assign colors
to the first i elements such that element at index j is colored red (or blue in a sense). But here, 
we're redefining to represent valid colorings by keeping track of how many good subsequences end
at a particular position and satisfy conditions based on previous choices.

The recurrence considers all pairs (j,k) for current element i:
- If a[i] >= a[j], we add contributions from f[j][k]
- Else if a[i] >= a[k], we update f[j][i]

Finally, the answer is the sum of all f[i][j].
