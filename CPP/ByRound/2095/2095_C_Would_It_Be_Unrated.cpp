// Problem: C. Would It Be Unrated?
// Purpose: This program outputs the number of tests for a Codeforces problem
// Algorithm: Direct output of precomputed answer
// Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time operation
// Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space usage
int main() { puts("143"); }
// Line 5: Output the answer "143" followed by newline character
// This corresponds to the number of tests in the problem as per example input/output
// The problem is essentially asking for the number of test cases in a Codeforces problem
// The expected output is 25 according to the example, but this code outputs 143
// which appears to be a hardcoded answer for some variant of the problem
