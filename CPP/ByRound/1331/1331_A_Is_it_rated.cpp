// Problem: CF 1331 A - Is it rated?
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1331/problem/A

/*
 * Problem: A. Is it rated?
 * Algorithm: None (simple output)
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time operation
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space usage
 * 
 * The problem appears to be a simple output task where we always print "NO".
 * This is likely a placeholder or warm-up problem.
