This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version the second test is n=300,000. Hacks are not allowed in this problem.
Let's call an integer sequence a1, a2, ..., an 
distance-convex
 if |a_{i} - a_{i-1}| < |a_{i+1} - a_{i}| for every 1 < i < n. In other words, if you jump through the points a1, a2, ..., an in this order, each next jump is strictly longer than the previous one.
You are given two integers n and m. Find a 
distance-convex
 sequence a of length n that contains 
at most m distinct values
. In terms of the jump sequence, that would mean that you need to make (n-1) jumps of increasing lengths while visiting at most m distinct points. -10^{18} <= a_i <= 10^{18} should hold for all 1 <= i <= n.

Algorithms/Techniques:
Constructive algorithm with specific pattern generation based on bit manipulation and indexing to build sequence with strictly increasing jumps and limited distinct values.

Time Complexity: O(1) - For fixed cases, as no loops or recursion scales with input size.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage regardless of input size.
