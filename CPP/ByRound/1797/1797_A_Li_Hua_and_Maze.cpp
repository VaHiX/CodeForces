/*
Problem: A. Li Hua and Maze
Purpose: Determine the minimum number of obstacles to block all paths between two points in an n√óm grid.
Algorithms/Techniques: Geometric analysis to find minimum cut based on position of start and end points relative to borders.
Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)
