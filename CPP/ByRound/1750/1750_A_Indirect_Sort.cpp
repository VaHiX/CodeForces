// Problem: CF 1750 A - Indirect Sort
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1750/problem/A

/*
 * Problem: Determine if a permutation can be sorted using special operations.
 * Algorithm: This is a constructive problem based on observing patterns in allowed operations.
 *            The key insight is that we can only modify elements through a limited set of swaps or additions.
 *            A necessary and sufficient condition for sorting is that the array must have at most one "break point",
 *            where an element is greater than the next element, and this break point should be such that 
 *            we're able to resolve it with the allowed operation. However, given small constraints (n <= 10),
 *            a brute-force analysis or simulation-like check is sufficient.
 *            
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2) per test case due to checking possible swaps/operations for each element.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only using constant extra space.
