// Problem: CF 1560 B - Who's Opposite?

/*
B. Who's Opposite?
Purpose: Given three people a, b, c in a circle where a looks at b (and vice versa), determine who c looks at.
         If no valid circle exists, return -1.

Algorithm:
- For a circle of n people numbered 1 to n, person i looks at person (i + n/2) % n if n is even.
- From known a and b, we deduce n using the fact they are opposite: |a - b| = n/2 â‡’ n = 2 * |a - b|.
- We can also verify that c must be within [1, n] for it to be valid.

Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)
