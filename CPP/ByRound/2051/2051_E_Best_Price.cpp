E. Best Price

Algorithms/Techniques: Sweep Line + Sorting + Two Pointers

Time Complexity: O(n log n) per test case due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing customer data

The problem involves setting an optimal price for Christmas trees such that the total revenue is maximized,
while limiting the number of negative reviews to at most k.

Approach:
- Each customer has two thresholds: a_i (positive review) and b_i (negative review).
- We use a sweep line technique by creating events for all a_i and b_i values.
- For each valid price point (where we can still have â‰¤k negative reviews), we compute the revenue.
- The key insight is that we want to place the price such that we maximize (number of customers who buy) * (price),
  where the number of customers who buy depends on how many are in [0, price] range.

This solution sorts all customer thresholds and sweeps through them, keeping track of current counts of
customers who could buy with a positive review vs negative review.
