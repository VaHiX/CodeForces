// Problem: CF 1362 A - Johnny and Ancient Computer

/*
 * Problem: Johnny and Ancient Computer
 * Algorithm: Greedy approach with reverse operations
 * Time Complexity: O(log(max(a,b))) per test case
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * Description:
 * We are given two numbers a and b. From a, we want to reach b using allowed operations:
 * - Multiply by 2, 4, or 8 (shift left)
 * - Divide by 2, 4, or 8 (shift right), only if divisible
 *
 * Strategy:
 * Since multiplication/division by powers of 2, we work backwards from b to a.
 * At each step, try dividing by 8, then 4, then 2 â€” in that order (greedy).
 * This is because larger divisions require fewer steps.
 *
 * If at any point we cannot divide (no valid division possible or division results in value < a),
 * return -1.
 *
 * Note: The algorithm is greedy and works because the optimal solution always uses the largest
 * possible division at each step, ensuring minimal steps.
