// Problem: CF 1767 A - Cut the Triangle

/*
A. Cut the Triangle
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test512 megabytes

Algorithm:
The problem asks whether we can cut a triangle into two non-degenerate triangles using a straight line that is either horizontal or vertical.

Key insight:
- For a valid cut, the line must pass through the triangle such that both resulting parts are also triangles.
- If the line is horizontal (y = constant), it intersects the triangle at most at two points and splits the triangle into two pieces only if one vertex lies above the line and another below.
- Similarly for vertical lines (x = constant).
- It's possible to do so **if** two of the vertices share the same x-coordinate or two of them share the same y-coordinate â€” allowing a vertical or horizontal cut respectively.

Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)
