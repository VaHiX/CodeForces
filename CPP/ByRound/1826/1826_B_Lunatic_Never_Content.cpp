/*
B. Lunatic Never Content
Algorithm: For each test case, find the largest positive integer x such that f(a, x) is a palindrome.
The key insight is to observe that for f(a, x) to be a palindrome, the elements at symmetric positions must be equal modulo x.
Letâ€™s define diff = a[i] - a[n-1-i], then diff % x must be 0 for all such pairs for the array to remain palindromic under modulo x.
Hence, we look for the GCD of all such absolute differences. If this GCD is 0 (i.e., the difference is always 0), 
then the array is already palindromic regardless of x -> x can be arbitrarily large so output is 0.

Time Complexity: O(n * log(max(a))) per test case, due to GCD computation.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the input array.
