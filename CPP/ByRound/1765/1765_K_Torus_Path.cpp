K. Torus Path
Algorithms/Techniques: Greedy, Matrix Traversal
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

The problem involves finding the maximum sum path from top-left to bottom-right
in an n√ón grid with special torus-like movement rules:
- Can only move right or down.
- Moving right from last column teleports to first column in same row.
- Moving down from last row teleports to first row in same column.
- Cannot revisit cells (including start and end).
The key insight is that the path must visit exactly n cells (since we need to 
move exactly n-1 steps right and n-1 steps down, but the starting cell is counted
from the beginning and the ending cell is not left). However, since there's a
special constraint involving the torus movement, the optimal solution can be found
by avoiding the minimum element on the main anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left),
as that is part of any possible path.

The approach:
1. Read all elements into a 2D matrix.
2. Calculate total sum of all elements.
3. Find the minimum value in the anti-diagonal (i-th row, n-i-1 column).
4. Subtract this minimum from the total sum to get the maximum score.

This is valid because:
- Any valid path must include exactly one element from the anti-diagonal.
- To maximize the sum of visited elements, we minimize the penalty,
  which is removing the smallest element on the anti-diagonal.
