// Problem: CF 1832 C - Contrast Value

/*
C. Contrast Value

Purpose:
Given an array of integers, construct the shortest subsequence such that its contrast (sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements) equals the contrast of the original array.

Algorithm:
1. Remove consecutive duplicate elements from input array to get a simplified version.
2. Count "peaks" and "valleys" in the simplified array â€” these are points where local maxima or minima occur.
3. The result is the count of such extrema plus 1 (if the array has more than one element), since we must keep at least the first and last elements to maintain contrast.

Time Complexity: O(n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the simplified array

Techniques:
- Two-pointer approach with deduplication
- Peak/valley counting in a sequence
