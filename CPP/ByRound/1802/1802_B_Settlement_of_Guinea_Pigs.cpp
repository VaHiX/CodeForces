// Problem: CF 1802 B - Settlement of Guinea Pigs
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1802/problem/B

/*
 * Problem: B. Settlement of Guinea Pigs
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Determine the minimum number of aviaries needed to ensure that at no point
 *   in time two guinea pigs of different genders live together, regardless of
 *   their actual genders.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   - Simulate the process day by day according to the plan.
 *   - Track the number of unknown-gender guinea pigs (u) and known-gender pairs (v).
 *   - When a doctor arrives (b_i == 2), all unknowns are resolved into pairs
 *     which can be merged into existing aviaries.
 *   - Use greedy strategy to determine minimum aviary count.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of days across all test cases.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) â€” only using a constant amount of extra space.
