People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they're too stupid and they've already taken over the world.
â€” Pedro Domingos

Algorithm/Techniques: 
The problem asks us to arrange numbers from 1 to n*k in a grid of n rows and k columns such that 
for every row, the average of any consecutive subarray is an integer. This means for any contiguous 
subset of items on a shelf, their sum must be divisible by the number of items in that subset.

Key insight:
- For the average to always be an integer, the sum of any contiguous subsequence in each row must 
  be divisible by the length of that subsequence.
- This condition is satisfied if and only if we can arrange numbers such that each row is 
  arithmetic progression with a common difference that ensures divisibility.

Time Complexity: O(n * k)
Space Complexity: O(n * k)

This solution works for most cases, except when n is odd and k > 1. In such cases,
it's impossible to arrange the numbers to satisfy the constraint. This is due to 
the parity property of arithmetic means in a sequence.

The approach:
- If n is odd and k > 1, then the arrangement is not possible (output "NO").
- Otherwise, we simply generate numbers sequentially row-wise with increasing column indices.

#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  long t;
  scanf("%ld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    long n, k;
    scanf("%ld %ld", &n, &k);
    // If n is odd and k > 1, it's impossible to satisfy the constraint
    if ((n % 2) && (k > 1)) {
      puts("NO");
      continue;
    }
    puts("YES");
    // Generate numbers row-wise using formula u + n * p
    for (long u = 1; u <= n; u++) {
      for (long p = 0; p < k; p++) {
        printf("%ld ", u + n * p);
      }
      puts("");
    }
  }
}
