Problem: A. Do Not Be Distracted!
Purpose: Determine if Polycarp followed the rule of solving one task to the end without switching back to a previous task.
Algorithm: 
    - For each test case, check if there exists any triplet of indices (i,j,k) such that:
        s[i] == s[j] and s[i] != s[k], where i < k < j
    - This represents an invalid pattern where a task is started, another task is done in between,
      then the original task is resumed â€” which violates the rule.
Time Complexity: O(n^3) due to three nested loops checking all possible triplets.
Space Complexity: O(1) as only a few variables are used and string input is not stored beyond use.

Techniques:
    - Brute force check of all triplets
    - Early termination when violation is found

            f = 1;  // Set flag indicating suspicious behavior
