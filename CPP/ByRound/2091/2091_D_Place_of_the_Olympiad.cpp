/*
D. Place of the Olympiad

Purpose:
This program determines the minimum possible length of the longest bench when placing k participants 
on an n√óm venue such that each participant gets one desk and benches consist of consecutive desks in a row.

Algorithms/Techniques:
Binary search on the answer combined with greedy placement logic to determine if a given maximum bench length is feasible.

Time Complexity: O(t * log(min(n,m))) where t is number of test cases
Space Complexity: O(1)

Input:
- t: number of test cases
- For each test case: n (rows), m (columns), k (number of participants)

Output:
- Minimum possible length of the longest bench

    // Compute minimum bench length required to place all participants
    // by dividing total participants by available spots per row, accounting 
    // for how many participants are already placed in previous rows.
