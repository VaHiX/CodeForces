// Problem: CF 1616 B - Mirror in the String

/*
B. Mirror in the String
Algorithm: Greedy approach to find the optimal mirror position k that minimizes the lexicographically 
           resulting string after mirroring s[0..k] and appending its reverse.
Time Complexity: O(n) per test case, where n is the length of the string.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to string operations and storage of substrings.

Approach:
- For each test case, we try to construct a mirrored string by choosing k optimally.
- We iterate through the string to find the longest prefix that is non-increasing (i.e., each character 
  is greater than or equal to the next one) â€“ this ensures we are building a palindrome-like structure
  when mirrored.
- If such a prefix exists, we take the mirror of it and compare with just the first two characters of s 
  appended to itself as a fallback. The lexicographically smaller result is output.

Key Points:
- We add 'z' at the end of s to make loop logic cleaner (avoids needing to check boundaries manually).
- We build string v (initially "s[0]s[0]") and compare against constructed mirrored string w.
