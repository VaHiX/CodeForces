/*
 * Problem: B. JoJo's Incredible Adventures
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Given a binary string s of length n, we construct an n√ón table where each row is
 * a cyclic right shift of the string s by k positions (k from 0 to n-1). Then we find
 * the maximum area of a rectangle consisting only of '1's in this table.
 *
 * Algorithms/Techniques:
 * - Preprocessing: For each row, compute the longest consecutive sequence of '1's
 *   that includes the current position, using dynamic programming and cyclic shifts.
 * - Optimization: The key idea is to find for each column, how many contiguous rows
 *   starting from some row have a '1' in that column. This leads to a maximum rectangle
 *   problem per column.
 * - The approach uses an efficient scan through the repeated string (2*n size) to 
 *   determine the maximum consecutive sequence of 1s and then uses it to compute the area.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) for each test case, as we traverse the string twice (2n) at most.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) additional space (excluding input/output).
