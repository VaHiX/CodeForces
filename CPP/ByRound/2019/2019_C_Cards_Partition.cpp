// Problem: CF 2019 C - Cards Partition

/*
C. Cards Partition
Algorithm: Binary search on answer + greedy validation
Time Complexity: O(n * log(max_sum))
Space Complexity: O(1)

The problem requires finding the maximum possible deck size after buying at most k cards,
such that all decks have equal size and no two cards with same value are in the same deck.

Key approach:
1. Use binary search on the answer (deck size).
2. For a given deck size s, check if we can form valid partitions:
   - Total cards needed = s * (number of decks)
   - Number of decks = total_cards / s
   - Each deck must have distinct values â‡’ max(cards_of_each_value) <= deck_size
   - We must be able to buy enough cards such that (total + buy) >= s * decks
