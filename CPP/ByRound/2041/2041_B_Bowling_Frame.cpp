B. Bowling Frame

Purpose:
This program calculates the maximum side length of a triangular bowling frame that can be constructed using a given number of white and black pins, under the constraint that all pins in any row must be the same color.

The triangular frame follows the pattern where a frame of side length k uses exactly k(k+1)/2 pins. The solution involves solving a quadratic inequality to find the largest valid k such that k(k+1)/2 â‰¤ w + b.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Mathematical optimization using quadratic formula
- Binary search (implicit in the derived closed-form solution)

Time Complexity: O(t), where t is the number of test cases. Each case processes in constant time after calculating the square root.

Space Complexity: O(1). Only a constant amount of extra space is used regardless of input size.

Input Format:
- First line contains integer t (number of test cases)
- For each test case, two integers w and b representing white and black pins respectively

Output Format:
- For each test case, output the maximum side length k of the triangular frame
