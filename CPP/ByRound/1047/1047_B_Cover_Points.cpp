B. Cover Points

Purpose: Find the minimum length of the shorter side of an isosceles triangle 
with two sides on coordinate axes that covers all given points.

Algorithm: 
- Since we need to place an isosceles triangle with two sides on coordinate axes,
  the triangle's vertices will be at (0,0), (a,0), and (0,a) where 'a' is the side length
- For any point (x,y) to be covered, it must satisfy x + y â‰¤ a
- Therefore, the minimum 'a' needed is the maximum value of (x + y) among all points

Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through all points
Space Complexity: O(1) - only using constant extra space
