B. Slice to Survive

Purpose:
This code computes the minimum number of turns required for Mouf to isolate Fouad's monster in an n√óm grid, assuming both players play optimally. Mouf tries to minimize the number of cuts (turns), while Fouad tries to maximize it.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- The problem is modeled as a game tree where each turn involves either cutting a row or column and then Fouad moves his monster.
- The key idea is that in each turn, Mouf makes a cut to reduce the grid size, and Fouad chooses a move to prolong the game.
- The optimal strategy for both players is to choose the most effective cuts to either minimize or maximize the number of turns.
- The minimum number of turns depends on the distance from the starting position (a,b) to the edges of the grid and how efficiently these can be reduced.

Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)
