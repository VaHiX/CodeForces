Salem gave you n sticks with integer positive lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from a to b is |a - b|, where |x| means the absolute value of x.
A stick length a_i is called 
almost good
 for some integer t if |a_i - t| <= 1.
Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer t and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of t is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 
As an answer, print the value of t and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for t, print any of them.

Algorithm: Sorting + Brute Force
Time Complexity: O(n log n + n * R) where R is the range of stick lengths (100 in constraints)
Space Complexity: O(n)

The solution works as follows:
- Sort the array to easily find median(s).
- Consider t values around the median to reduce search space.
- For each candidate t, compute the total cost of modifying sticks such that all are within [t-1, t+1].
- The range for t is limited to median Â± 1 to ensure minimum cost.
