// Problem: CF 1926 E - Vlad and an Odd Ordering
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1926/problem/E

/*
Algorithm: 
The problem involves generating a specific ordering of cards from 1 to n. 
The ordering is done by groups, where each group consists of numbers that are k times an odd number, 
processed in increasing order of k (starting from 1). 

For each group k, we count how many valid cards are there (i.e., those that are multiples of k and are â‰¤ n, 
and the quotient is odd). 

The algorithm simulates this process:
- It iterates through powers of 2 (2^i) to determine which group the k-th card belongs to.
- For each group, it calculates how many elements are in that group.
- Once the group is identified, it computes the actual card number using a formula derived from the pattern.

Time Complexity: O(log n) per test case, since we are iterating over powers of 2 up to n.
Space Complexity: O(1), only using a constant amount of extra space.
