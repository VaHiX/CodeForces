// Problem: CF 1812 E - Not a Geometry Problem
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1812/problem/E

/*
Code Purpose:
This code calculates a mathematical expression involving three integers x, y, and z.
The expression computed is: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / (x*y + y*z + z*x) when the denominator is non-zero,
otherwise it returns a large predefined value when all inputs are zero.

Algorithms/Techniques:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic for handling special cases
- Floating-point arithmetic

Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time operations
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage

Note: The actual implementation logic appears to be incomplete or incorrect based on the problem description.
The given code only outputs "0" and doesn't implement the required mathematical calculation.
