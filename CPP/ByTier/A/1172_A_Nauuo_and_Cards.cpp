A. Nauuo and Cards
Algorithms/Techniques: Simulation, Greedy
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards.
One day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones.
There are n cards numbered from 1 to n, and they were mixed with another n empty cards. She piled up the 2n cards and drew n of them. The n cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining n cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom.
In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it â€” put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile.
Nauuo wants to make the n numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the i-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card i) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations?
