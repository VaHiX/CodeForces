Problem: A. Silent Classroom
Purpose: Given n students with names starting with certain letters, split them into two classrooms to minimize the number of "chatty" pairs â€” pairs of students whose names start with the same letter and are in the same classroom.

Algorithm:
- Count how many students have names starting with each letter (a-z).
- For each group of students with names starting with the same letter, compute the minimum number of chatty pairs when split into two classrooms.
- To minimize pairs, try all possible ways to split a group of size `v[p]` into two non-empty groups and choose the split that minimizes total pairs.
- Since each student contributes to a pair if they are in the same classroom, we process each letter's count independently.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of students (counting names and splitting).
Space Complexity: O(1) as we use fixed-size vector of 26 elements for letters 'a' to 'z'.
