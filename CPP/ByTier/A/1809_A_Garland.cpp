// Problem: CF 1809 A - Garland
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1809/problem/A

/*
 * Problem: Garland
 * Purpose: Determine the minimum number of operations to turn all 4 light bulbs on,
 *          given that each operation can only be applied to a bulb of a different color
 *          than the previously operated bulb.
 *
 * Algorithms/Techniques:
 *   - Sorting to group same colors together
 *   - Case analysis based on sorted string patterns
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(t * log(4)) â‰ˆ O(t), where t is number of test cases.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only using a fixed amount of extra space.
