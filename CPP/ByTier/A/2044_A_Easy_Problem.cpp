Problem: Count ordered pairs of positive integers (a,b) such that a = n - b
Algorithm: Mathematical observation
- For equation a = n - b where both a and b are positive integers
- We need a > 0 and b > 0
- From a = n - b and a > 0: n - b > 0 â†’ b < n
- From b > 0 and b < n: 0 < b < n
- Since b is a positive integer, b can take values 1, 2, ..., n-1
- So there are exactly (n-1) valid ordered pairs
Time Complexity: O(t) where t is number of test cases
Space Complexity: O(1)
