// Problem: CF 1217 A - Creating a Character

/*
 * Problem: Count valid character builds where strength > intelligence after investing all exp points.
 *
 * Algorithm: 
 * - For a character with initial str, int and exp points:
 *   - We want final_str > final_int
 *   - Let x = points added to strength, (exp - x) points added to intelligence
 *   - Condition becomes: str + x > int + (exp - x)
 *   - Simplifying: 2*x > int - str + exp => x > (int - str + exp)/2
 *   - Also x must be in [0, exp] range.
 *   - So valid x are from ceil((int - str + exp)/2) to exp inclusive.
 *   - But if final_str <= final_int, that's invalid â€” count those cases too.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
