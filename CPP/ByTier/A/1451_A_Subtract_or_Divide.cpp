// Problem: CF 1451 A - Subtract or Divide

/*
Problem: Minimum Moves to Reduce N to 1
Algorithm/Techniques: Mathematical reasoning and case analysis
Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)

Approach:
- If n is 1, no moves needed.
- If n is 2 or 3, we can reach 1 in 1 and 2 moves respectively.
- If n is even, we can divide by 2 to get an odd number or 1 in 1 step (if it's 2) or 2 steps (if it's greater than 2).
- If n is odd:
    - If n is a prime, we must subtract 1 (to make it even), then divide until 1 â†’ 3 moves.
    - Otherwise, we can divide by any of its proper divisors to reduce the number in 2 steps.

This solution uses properties of numbers and divisor analysis to determine minimum steps.

    } else if (n % 2 == 0) {
      puts("2"); // Even numbers can be divided by 2 to get an odd number or a small even, and in worst case 2 moves needed
    } else if (n % 2) {
      puts("3"); // Odd numbers not prime, we go 3 -> 1 via divisors or subtractions = 3 steps
    } else {
      puts("-1"); // This line will never be reached due to above conditions covering all cases
