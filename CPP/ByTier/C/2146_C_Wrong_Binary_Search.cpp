C. Wrong Binary Search
Algorithms/Techniques: 
  - Greedy construction with segment reversal
  - Segment processing based on consecutive same characters in binary string
Time Complexity: O(n) amortized per test case
Space Complexity: O(n)

The problem asks to construct a permutation such that an element i is "stable" 
if and only if s[i] == '1'. An element x is stable if the binary search-like 
function find(x) always returns a valid index where p[find(x)] == x, regardless
of how mid-point is chosen during the search.

Key insight:
  - If s[i] == '1', then i must be stable. This means that after all operations,
    the value at position i in the permutation should not conflict with 
    what's expected from binary search.
  - If s[i] == '0', then i must NOT be stable.

The algorithm processes the string by grouping consecutive identical characters,
and for groups of '0's, we reverse the corresponding segment of the permutation.
For a group of '0's, if there is only a single element (i==j) and we reverse it,
that element will incorrectly become stable. Thus, we check for this case.

The approach:
1. Process each group of consecutive same characters in s.
2. For group of '1's: do nothing â€” keep the current permutation order.
3. For group of '0's: reverse the corresponding segment in p to make elements unstable.
4. Special care is taken when a '0' is standalone (i == j), which causes a conflict.
