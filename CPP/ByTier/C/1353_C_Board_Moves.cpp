// Problem: CF 1353 C - Board Moves

/*
C. Board Moves
Purpose: Calculate the minimum number of moves to gather all figures on a single cell of an n√ón board (n is odd).
Algorithm: Mathematical formula derivation for minimizing Manhattan distances from all cells to the center.
Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)

The problem reduces to finding the sum of Manhattan distances from all cells to the center cell (n/2, n/2).
Each cell (i,j) has distance |i - n/2| + |j - n/2|.
We simplify this by observing symmetry and using the formula for sum of squares.
The derived formula is: 8 * n * (n+1) * (2*n+1) / 6 where n is halved before computation.
