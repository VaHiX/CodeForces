// Problem: CF 1662 M - Bottle Arrangements
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1662/problem/M

/*
 * Code Purpose:
 * This program determines whether it's possible to arrange a sequence of red (R) and white (W) wine bottles
 * such that each critic's request for a specific number of red and white wines in some contiguous interval
 * can be satisfied. It uses a greedy approach to construct the arrangement.
 *
 * Algorithms/Techniques:
 * - Greedy Algorithm: The core idea is to determine the minimum number of red and white wines needed
 *   to satisfy all critic requests by taking the maximum required for each type across all critics.
 * - Construction: Once we know the minimal required red and white wine counts (r and w), we construct
 *   a sequence of r reds followed by w whites if their sum equals n, otherwise it's impossible.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(m) per test case, where m is the number of critics.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) â€” only using a fixed amount of extra space.
