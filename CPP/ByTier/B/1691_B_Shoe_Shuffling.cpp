// Problem: CF 1691 B - Shoe Shuffling

/*
B. Shoe Shuffling
Algorithm: Greedy + Grouping
Time Complexity: O(n) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n) per test case

The problem requires us to redistribute shoes among students such that:
1. No student gets their own shoes (p[i] != i)
2. Each student gets shoes of size >= their own size

Approach:
- Group consecutive equal elements together.
- For each group, we determine how to assign shoes properly.
- If any group has only one element, then we can't redistribute without assigning
  that student their own shoe â€” hence impossible.
- In the case where all items are equal, any valid permutation is acceptable.

Key logic:
We iterate through the array and group consecutive elements with same value.
For groups of size > 1, we attempt to assign shoes in a cyclic manner.
If any group has size 1, output -1.
