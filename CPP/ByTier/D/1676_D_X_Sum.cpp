// Problem: CF 1676 D - X-Sum
// https://codeforces.com/contest/1676/problem/D

/*
D. X-Sum
Purpose: Given an n√óm grid of non-negative integers, find the maximum sum of cells that can be attacked by placing a bishop on any cell. A bishop attacks diagonally in all four directions (including the cell it stands on).

Algorithm:
- For each diagonal going from top-left to bottom-right, we precompute the sum of values in that diagonal (stored in map s).
- For each diagonal going from top-right to bottom-left, we precompute the sum of values in that diagonal (stored in map d).
- For every cell (i,j), compute the total sum as: s[i+j] + d[i-j] - a[i][j], and keep track of the maximum.
- This works because when placing a bishop at (i,j), it covers all cells in diagonals i+j and i-j, but we must avoid double counting the cell itself.

Time Complexity: O(n*m) per test case
Space Complexity: O(n+m) for maps s and d

Input Format:
- t: number of test cases
- n, m: dimensions of grid
- n lines with m integers each representing the grid values

Output Format:
- For each test case, a single integer representing the maximum sum achievable.
