/*
 * Problem: D. Number into Sequence
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Given an integer n > 1, decompose it into a sequence of integers such that:
 *   - Each element is greater than 1.
 *   - Product of the sequence equals n.
 *   - Each element divides the next one (i.e., a[i+1] % a[i] == 0).
 *   - Maximize the length of the sequence.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   - Factorize n into prime factors.
 *   - For each prime factor p with exponent e, we can create a subsequence:
 *     p, p^2, ..., p^e.
 *   - The goal is to maximize k (number of elements) in the final sequence.
 *   - To do that:
 *     1. Find prime factorization of n.
 *     2. For each prime factor p with power e:
 *        - Add p, p^2, ..., p^(eâˆ’1), p^e to result list.
 *     3. This gives a valid sequence where the last element is always divisible
 *        by the previous one since all are powers of the same base.
 *     4. The maximum number of elements is simply the number of prime factors (counted with multiplicity).
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 *   For each n, O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
 *   Since sum of n is bounded to 10^10, and t <= 5000,
 *   total time complexity is acceptable within constraints.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 *   O(log n) due to storing the factor map (at most log n distinct prime factors).
