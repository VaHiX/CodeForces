// https://codeforces.com/contest/952/problem/D

/*
 * Code Purpose: This program determines where to place a chip on a roulette table
 *               for a "Feeling Lucky" bet. It outputs "Even" as the bet selection.
 * 
 * Algorithms/Techniques: Simple decision making based on the problem requirement
 *                        to place a chip on an "Even" number bet.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time operation as it performs a single output operation
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage as no additional data structures are needed
 */
