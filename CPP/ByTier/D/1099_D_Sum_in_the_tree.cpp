D. Sum in the tree
Algorithms/Techniques: Tree traversal, greedy assignment, min heap simulation
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Mitya has a rooted tree with n vertices indexed from 1 to n, where the root has index 1.
Each vertex v initially had an integer number a_v >= 0 written on it.
For every vertex v Mitya has computed s_v: the sum of all values written on the vertices
on the path from vertex v to the root, as well as h_v â€” the depth of vertex v,
which denotes the number of vertices on the path from vertex v to the root.
Clearly, s_1=a_1 and h_1=1.
Then Mitya erased all numbers a_v, and by accident he also erased all values s_v
for vertices with even depth (vertices with even h_v). Your task is to restore
the values a_v for every vertex, or determine that Mitya made a mistake.
In case there are multiple ways to restore the values, you're required to find one
which minimizes the total sum of values a_v for all vertices in the tree.
